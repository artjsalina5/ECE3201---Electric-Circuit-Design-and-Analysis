# ECE 3201: Electronic Circuit Design and Analysis

This repository serves as a backup of my work for this course.

All work is my own. Be forewarned: [The Student Code](https://community.uconn.edu/the-student-code/the-student-code-preamble/).
UConn has a fair share of cheaters that were spawned during the Zoom days of the COVID-19 lockdown.
I have heard people bragging about how they cheated on AP exams and SAT exams to get to where they are.
